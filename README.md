# FruitQualitySortingSystem
 
Fruit Quality Sorting System is my final year project when I was pursuing Bachelor of Computer Science in Software Engineering. is fruit quality evaluation system based on image processing or machine learning. It was developed to evaluate the fruits and show results in terms of quality of fruits. The system will do image processing on the image of fruit and use the pretrained algorithm model to evaluate the quality of fruit accurately in a fast response time. Three machine learning algorithm which is KNN, CNN, and SVM were compared to find the most accurate algorithm before implementing to the system to ensure the accurate result of the fruit quality.

Techniques/Languages: Python, SQLite, phpMyAdmin, OpenCV, PyQT5, CNN Algorithm, KNN Algorithm, SVM Algorithm, Project Jupyter
